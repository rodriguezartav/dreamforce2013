How and Why Rodco build an App Store with Salesforce and Heroku

Gartner Research states that soon most companies will run their own Private App Stores. In this session you’ll get a first hand experience at one of the first Enterprise App Stores built on top of Salesforce, Heroku and the Best Open Source Technologies. 

Join Rodco’s CTO and Inventor as he explains why he choose to experiment with the Private App Store Business Strategy and how he used it to jump over the current barriers of enterprise software development heading towards business innovation. 

The Rodco Private App Store is Open Source and uses Twitter Bootstrap, SpineJS and NodeJS on the Frontend with a modified Command Pattern that runs on Force.com. 

It’s integrated with services such as Pusher.io , Mixpanel and Twilio and takes advantage of most Salesforce.com Technologies like Rest API, Bulk API, Outbound Messaging, Realtime Feeds, Chatter, etc. 

Attendees will leave this session with a complete understanding of the frameworks and architecture as well as the Code and Documentation Resources to start their own Private App Store.

The objective is to share our story, knowledge and experience while experimenting with this disruptive technology. Rodco is part of the construction vertical based in Costa Rica, we are early adopter of the Force.com Platform and are innovating our business model to offer our technology to others. By September 2013 we'll be releasing Documentation and Code so other companies can collaborate with our Private App Store.

Audience Engagement:
 By posting Session Planning Details on Chatter to pre-engage the Audience by allowing them to influence the Focus of Session and thus validate their interest on Session Specific Contents.
 Depending on the Time and Date of the Session I plan to do a "Wake Up or Networking 2 minute Exercise"
 During the presentation and between each section, there will be a two minute break for Q&A and/or Section Review Links, Next Steps, etc
 I'll let the audience know that I set aside the next two full days after the presentation to exclusively meet, email and chatter about the session contents and related topics.

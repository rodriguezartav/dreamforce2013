How and Why Rodco build an App Store with Salesforce and Heroku

Gartner Research states that soon most companies will run their own Private App Stores. In this session you’ll get a first hand experience at one of the first Enterprise App Stores built on top of Salesforce, Heroku and the Best Open Source Technologies. 

Join Rodco’s CTO and Inventor as he explains why he choose to experiment with the Private App Store Business Strategy and how he used it to jump over the current barriers of enterprise software development heading towards business innovation. 

The Rodco Private App Store is Open Source and uses Twitter Bootstrap, SpineJS and NodeJS on the Frontend with a modified Command Pattern that runs on Force.com. 

It’s integrated with services such as Pusher.io , Mixpanel and Twilio and takes advantage of most Salesforce.com Technologies like Rest API, Bulk API, Outbound Messaging, Realtime Feeds, Chatter, etc. 

Attendees will leave this session with a complete understanding of the frameworks and architecture as well as the Code and Documentation Resources to start their own Private App Store.

The objective is to share our story, knowledge and experience while experimenting with this disruptive technology. Rodco is part of the construction vertical based in Costa Rica, we are early adopter of the Force.com Platform and are innovating our business model to offer our technology to others. By September 2013 we'll be releasing Documentation and Code so other companies can collaborate with our Private App Store.
